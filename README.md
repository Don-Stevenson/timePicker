# TimePickr

### No more having to pick a time when you don't know when you want to meet up

Timepickr lets you choose `am` or `pm` and then it generates a time for you to the quarter of an hour e.g. 00, 15, 30, or 45.

### Intall TimePickr

- requires `node v16` or higher
- `clone` the repo and then install the dependencies with `npm install` within the created directory. Run with `node timePickr.js`
